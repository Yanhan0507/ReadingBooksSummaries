Clock is not reliable.
Time of a day, may periodically sync to network time protocol NTP server (since epoch time). It may jump back sometimes.
Monotonic clock, a time since your machine starts or something, only increasing. Duration usually measured by this kinda clock.

GC(stop of world) is an good example that any thread can be paused at anytime.

Byzantine faults:
Sometimes some worker may tend to lie.
