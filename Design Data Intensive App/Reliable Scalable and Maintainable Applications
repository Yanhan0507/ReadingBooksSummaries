When estimating traffic, ask if itâ€™s fast growing service: * 2 or *3

Disk knowledge:
RAID: redundant array of inexpensive disk
Raid 0: striping. For striping. Data evenly across two or more disks. - for perf mainly
A1  A2
A3  A4
Raid 1: mirroring. two exact same copy of data in two disks. - data redundancy. Read is better.
A1    A1
A2    A2
A3    A3
A4    A4

Raid 5:  (One parity block), say, 5 drives, one is for redundancy based on parity. (1/5  drive is for redundancy while raid has to pay half of drives for the same thing) and any ONE drive can die without losing data)
A1 A2 A3 A4 AP   

Raid 6:   (two parity blocks) and any TWO drive can data without losing data
A1 A2 A3 AP AP1
5,6 may punish write a bit as it has to compute parity block and write to it.

Example of SLO 9995: median response time is 200ms, 99% percentile response time is 1s is defined as up/available.
And 99.95 percent of time the system is available/up.
High percentile customer is valuable sometimes as at amazon they would be the customers which checkout most stuff.
So tail latency matters.
Tail latency amplification: if a request to go to all backends, and only a small number of backend receive requests
is slow for each backend sever(tail latency), then overall requests would be very slow, called tail latency amplification. 
Proportionally increase.
