Linearizability: to make a system appear as if there is only one copy of the data.

CAP:
Consistency, availability, partition tolerance

When network failure happened, so network is partitioned, you need to choose between availability and consistency. A)
if available, then we have two sets of node work independenly, so inconsistent. B) if consistent, then they have to stop working.
CAP theorem is only for one kinda of failure(network is partitioned), there are other failures also, dealys, dead nodes…

Zookeeper is usually for small amount of metadata. E.g. which partition goes to which node…
