There is a director and a builder.
Director is a ordinary class which will involve an abstract build to do things.
This abstract will be concrete builder at runtime and do things accordingly.

Abstract class GameBuilder
{
      virtural buildPlayer();
      virtural buildMonster();
      virtural Game getGame();
}


class NinjaGameBuilder
{
    Game g;
    buildPlayer()
    {
      calling some private functions to create ninja.
      g.add(ninja);
    }
    
    buildMonster();
    {
      calling some private functions to create ninjaMonster.
      g.add(ninjaMonster);
    }
    
    Game getGame()
    {
      return g;
    }
}


Game GameCreater::createGame(GameBuilder b)
{
  b.buildPlayer();
  b.buildMonster();
  return b.getGame();
}

In Builder classs, you are able to construct objects step by step with different builder. And to add a new things,
you just need to create a new builder.
