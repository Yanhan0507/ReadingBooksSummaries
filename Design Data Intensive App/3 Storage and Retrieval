TPCDS: 99 queries  OLTP
TPCH: 22 queries OLAP
TPCE: OLTP
Power run order: run queries one by one

OLTP: huge number of queries, each query is small/lightweight, but response time needs to be quick,
important scenario, you cannot lose any of record. Queries usually issued by real customers.

OLAP: for analytical workload, number of queries is small, but each query is big, column store might
be used as usually we will only select a few columns or aggregated statistics about several rows not
all rows of fact table, fact table can be very huge with hundreds of rows. (fact table and dimension
table. Fact tables is huge which may have hundreds of columns and referencing all dimension table.
E.g. product id = 1001 ,  1001 - coke - black - $2.5 ) some columns are very relevant, (becoz queries
would be select salary, age from table not select * from table where uid = 3), easier to compress.
(a ypical query can be to search what product are usually bought with A together). Queries usually issued
by data scientists.

HTAP: Hybrid transactional/analytical processing

OLTP: B Tree - LSM(log structured merge) tree. Btree is read faster. LSM is write fast as it’s writing
to memory and then merge. But LSM’s read can be very slow as it needs to go back from memory then last segment,
to the very first segment 

Materialized view makes more sense in OLAP as it add some write overhead but it can create a view for something like,
count, max, min which is something OLAP cares a lot.

Branching factor, (each node many elements. Branching factor: 500, lvl 4, 256. Each page 4kb.
