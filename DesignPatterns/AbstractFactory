Uses a factory class to create objs.
Pro:
Client does not need to know the implementation of any specific products, it just needs to know the common
interface. It isolates each concrete class.
Con:
Clients may not be able to call any specific function of any concrete class.

Implementation


Interface/Abstract class Factory
{
  Product CreateProduct();
}

class AFactory implements/extends Factory
{
  Product CreateProduct()
  {
    return new AProduct();
  }
}

class bFactory implements/extends Factory
{
  Product CreateProduct()
  {
    return new BProduct();
  }
}


Interface Product
{

}

class AProduct implements/extends Product
{}

class BProduct implements/extends Product
